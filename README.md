<h3 align="left">Keo World (2021 - Now) - Front End Developer</h3>

At KEO, I have played an integral role in launching financial products for key markets in Mexico, Brazil, Canada, and Peru. I was responsible for developing the front-end and a significant portion of the business logic, including key modules such as structuring customer acquisition processes, credit risk analysis, registering personalized credit lines for each client, managing credit cards within the American Express network, creating debt systems, and overseeing payment administration.

Beyond my core responsibilities, I have taken on additional roles ranging from software design to the implementation of microservices. I have led the migration of web applications to scalable architectures, ensuring the long-term sustainability of our technological solutions. Additionally, I have developed internal libraries that optimize both system design and the efficient development of APIs using a hexagonal architecture.

My focus on innovation and continuous improvement has enabled KEO to remain at the forefront of the financial industry, delivering robust and adaptable solutions that meet the evolving needs of our clients.

<h3 align="left">Konrad Lorenz (2019-2021) - Research assistant & Software engineer</h3>

As a Research Assistant, I played a key role in the development and implementation of a web application focused on adaptive learning, designed to enhance the educational experience for students in discrete mathematics. This system identified the areas where each student faced the most challenges, offering a personalized curriculum tailored to their learning preferences.

My work included developing tools to generate detailed reports on exam grades, enabling the identification of topics where students demonstrated deficiencies. Additionally, I implemented features that provided targeted reinforcement for areas in which students struggled, contributing to a significant improvement in their academic performance.

This project not only delivered a solution that made learning more engaging and accessible for students but also enabled more effective and personalized educational interventions, resulting in marked improvements in learning outcomes.

<h3 align="left">Pinturas Infinity (2021) - Intern software engineer</h3>

At Pinturas Infinity, as an engineering intern, I led a project to optimize and systematize processes in paint production, which previously faced inefficiencies due to manual calculations and frequent errors. Over six months, I designed and implemented a web application for inventory management, integrating an input-output system that improved accuracy and material traceability.

Additionally, I developed a specialized module that streamlined the production of custom colors by using a conversion algorithm for the CMYK system, ensuring more precise results in color mixing. Finally, I conducted training sessions for factory staff, ensuring a smooth transition to the new system and promoting effective information management.
